Some of the main programs have embedded Plain Old Documentation. 
Use e.g. perldoc or the pod2* programs (pod2html, pod2man, pod2txt, ...)
to view these.

The main pipe is called as search_profile_matching_genes.sh.

Find sequenes bearing a given motif in genomic draft seqeucence. Uses
GeneWise after some non-stringent blast filtering of contigs (split
into performance-wise convenient pieces), well knowing the author of
GeneWise might not have approved. Classifies the predicted peptides by
means of phylogenetic tree construction over the extracted motif with
a reference seed set.
